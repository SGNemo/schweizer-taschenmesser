# Comfort review – 03 Results (before / after)

Counts follow the method of [01-friction.md](01-friction.md) (code-traced, Desktop / Android).

## Package 1a – undo for every delete (`feat/comfort-row-actions`)
| Action | Before | After |
|---|---|---|
| Delete a booking, invoice, subscription, event, note, bookmark, pantry item, person/gift, budget/goal/deposit (D / A) | 2–3 / 2–3, permanent | 2–3 / 2–3, **undo with 1 tap** (toast) or Ctrl+Z |
| Pause a subscription, pantry − / + | 1 / 1, no undo | 1 / 1, undo toast |

Not changed on purpose: vault documents (file bytes cannot be restored), chat thread delete (keeps its confirm dialog), automatic chat retention clean-up, invoice "bezahlt" (its undo also removes the booking, which the journal cannot do).
Tests: `checkModules.test.ts` (rule), `core/undo/deleteWithUndo.test.ts`, e2e `money.spec.ts` "comes back with Rückgängig".
