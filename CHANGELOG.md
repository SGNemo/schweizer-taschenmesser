# Changelog

Release notes are generated from Conventional Commits (`npm run changelog -- --version <x.y.z>` in `web/`); this file mirrors the published releases. Full lists with commit links: [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/SGNemo/schweizer-taschenmesser/releases).

## Unreleased
- Rebrand to **Nemo**: new clownfish mark ("Welle"), flat "Klar" design (tokens, shared controls), MIT licence, short README with user docs under `docs/user/`, roadmap, review report.
- Fixes: Android launcher icons are copied into the generated project, monochrome status-bar icon for notifications, local day in the last-sync timestamp, all internal identifiers pinned by tests, legacy encrypted/vault backup fixtures, release asset pairs verified byte for byte.
- Merged `develop` (#8: disk cleaner, pantry, timetrack, gifts, system, four tools); the system page uses the shared progress bar.
- Housekeeping: dead exports and strings removed, shared helpers (`pad2`, e2e `ready`/`enable`), CI caches, format checks.
